This is a basic trouble ticket system utilizing .net 8.0 and ChatGPT for trouble ticket analysis. 

This requires SQLEXPRESS with an sa password (set your SA Password in the app.config)
This also requires .net 8.0 runtimes
This also works without ChatGPT analysis, however if you want to use the Analysis tab, you have to create a project in platform.openai.com and get yourself an API Key. Then you paste your own API Key in the Analysis folder in order to get analysis of your tickets.
